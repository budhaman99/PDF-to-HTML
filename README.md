# PDF-to-HTML
C# App that pulls text and images from a PDF file and puts them in a very simple HTML file.

This came from a want to read large PDF docs on my phone without having to deal with the static nature of PDFs. With a simple HTML page the text will autowrap so you don't have to zoom out or scrol left to right.
